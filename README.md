# smash_meetup

## General idea
Mobile app built on React Native that allows users to find nearby players to play any version of Super Smash Brothers games. 

Users will be able to have live chat functionality via web sockets. They'll be able to chat with their friends to decide where they want to meetup and other logistics.

Users will be able to have a list of profile settings including:
- Skill level
- Willing to host
- Main(s)
- Secondary
- etc

Users will be able to broadcast their location via Google Maps geolocation if they're a host.

Users will be able to log in via Facebook, Google, or regular login using OAUTH2.0
